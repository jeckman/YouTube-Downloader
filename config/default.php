/*
 * Multiple IPs
 *
 * You can enable this option if you are having problems with youtube IP limit / IP ban.
 * This option will work only if the IP you add are available for the server.
 * That means you have to buy some additionnal public IPs and assign these new static IPs to the server.
 * This should work only if you have a dedicated server...
 *
 * Example of adding additional IPs to Ubuntu server 14.04 LTS
 * !!!! Be very careful, you may block yourself !!!!
 * !!!! If you are connecting to your server remotly by ssh. You would do this only if you know what you do !!!!
 * !!!! This is only an example with a specific dedicated server (ovh.net) !!!!
 *
 * For this example, the main IP on the server is 123.456.789.001
 * We want to add additionnal IPs 789.456.123.001 and 789.456.123.002
 *
 * Edit /etc/network/interfaces and put something like this:
 *
 * # The loopback network interface
 * auto lo
 * iface lo inet loopback
 *
 * # The Main server IP:
 * auto eth0
 * iface eth0 inet static
 *     address 123.456.789.001
 *     netmask 255.255.255.0
 *     network 123.456.789.0
 *     broadcast 123.456.789.255
 *     gateway 123.456.789.254
 *
 * # Additionnal IP: 789.456.123.001
 * auto eth0:0
 * iface eth0:0 inet static
 *     address 789.456.123.001
 *     netmask 255.255.255.255
 *     broadcast 789.456.123.001
 *     gateway 123.456.789.254
 *
 * # Additionnal IP: 789.456.123.002
 * auto eth0:1
 * iface eth0:0 inet static
 *     address 789.456.123.002
 *     netmask 255.255.255.255
 *     broadcast 789.456.123.002
 *     gateway 123.456.789.254
 *
 * # Additionnal IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 * auto eth0:2
 * iface eth0:2 inet static
 * (...)
 *
 * and so on for each IP you want to add....
 *
 * Reboot your server
 * If you are having trouble and cannot connect anymore over ssh to your server,
 * that means your new network configuration has errors...
 * So be very careful before applying your configuration.
 * Try it first on a local dev server before messing up with your pro server.
